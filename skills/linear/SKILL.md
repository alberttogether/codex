# Linear Tickets (Engineering + MLEng)

## Scope

- All tickets live in Linear for the Engineering or MLEng teams.
- MLEng is a subteam of Engineering; MLOps work is part of MLEng.
- Ticket prefixes: Engineering uses `ENG-`, ML engineering uses `MLE-`.

## Workflow

1. Identify the team (Engineering or MLEng) based on the request.
2. Use Linear MCP tools to list or query issues by team, state, project, or search term.
3. When a specific issue is referenced (e.g., `MLE-2526`), fetch details with `get_issue`.
4. Summarize status, owner, and next actions; include the Linear URL.
